<title>Manipulating Data</title>

<p>
There are many different ways to manipulate data using Graphs. All data is
treated the same using Graphs, independent what file it is imported from, or if
it's a generated equation. When selecting a part of the canvas using the
Highlight tool, only the highlight area will be manipulated.

<title>Smoothening</title>
<p>
The smoothening action has two different modes, a rolling average or the
Savitzky-Galov filter. The moving average simply works iterating through the
data set, and replacing each point by the average of the last few data points
that were encountered, this way sharp outliers are ignored but details may be
lost. Sudden actual changes in the data may also be detected later when a
smoothening has been applied. Another way to smoothen the data is the
Savitzky-Galov. The difference with the moving average, is that not a simple
average is used for the last data points, but instead a polynomial function is
fitted between the data points. This makes it possible to filter the
underlaying signal still quite nicely out of very noisy data.

<title>Custom Transformations</title>
<p>
Another way to manipulate the data is by using custom transformations. This
field transforms both X and Y coordinate piece by piece according to an
equation of choice. For instance, to take the square of all Y-coordinates,
simply set <code>Y = YÂ²</code> on the y-data field, and <code>X = X</code> on
the x-data field. Note that the input coordinates are not case-sensitive.
