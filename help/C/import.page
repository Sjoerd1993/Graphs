<title>Importing Data</title>
<p>
There are two primary ways to import new data in Graphs, importing data directly
by file or generating new data using an equation.

A wide array of filetypes are supported when importing data by file. Graphs
currently supports Panalytical .xrdml files, Leybold .xry files as well as
files that are saved in a column format such as most .csv files, .dat files,
.xy files or plain text. Finally, data from other Graphs projects can be
imported into the current project as well, simply by adding new data as usual,
but by selecting a project file instead.

When using a custom delimiter during the import, an extra field will be visible
to enter the delimiter of choice. This field recognizes regular expressions.
For example, to choose a delimiter that looks for whitespace, one could enter
<code>\s+</code> as delimiter. In this example, <code>\s</code> denotes that
the delimiter is a whitespace character, and the <code>+</code> denotes that at
least one or more whitespace is required. Thus this input looks for any amount
of whitespaces including tabs. Note that this particular input is equivalent to
the default Whitespace option.

The other way to import data is to generate data directly using an equation.
This can be done using the "Add Equation" button found in the top-left
corner, or by pressing <cmd>Ctrl+Alt+N</cmd>. Most commonly used syntax is
accepted, with an <code>x</code> denoting the x-coordinate. A simple quadratic
equation could for instance be created using <code>xÂ²+5</code> as input. Be
aware that trigonometric functions are using radians by default. If you want to
use degrees, simply add a <code>d</code> to the trigonometric function. For
instance <code>cosd(x)</code> generates a cosine where the x coordinate is
given in degrees while <code>cos(x)</code> generates a cosine with the
x-coordinate in radians.
